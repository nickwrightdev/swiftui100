## 100 Days of Swift UI

I'm following the "100 Days of Swift UI" challenge by Paul Hudson.
   
[https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

Part of the challenge is posting progress, so I will keep a public github repo of my work.

My iOS development skills have gotten rusty, so this should be good.

### Progress Update #1
After completing the first 48 days, I took a break from this for about a month.    Work, family, and holidays get in the way of my free time all too often.

I am going to complete the last half of this over the next 50 days.
