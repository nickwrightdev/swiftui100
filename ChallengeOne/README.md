# Challenge One
This is the first challenge where we have to create our own app using lessons learned thus far.   The goal is to create an app that will handle unit conversion.    

## TempConverter
The simple app will convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

The conversions are simple math calculations we can make ourselves, but Swift also has a struct **Measurement** that handles various unit conversions.   I explored both methods in UnitConversion.playground.

## Thoughts
Maybe it would be fun to make a more useful converter after I complete the 100 day course.
