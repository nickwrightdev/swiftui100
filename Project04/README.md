# BetterRest
This is the 4th project in the SwiftUI in 100 days series, and the first look at combining SwiftUI with Core ML (Machine Learning).

## Overview
The app allows the user input with a date picker and two steppers, which combined will tell us when they want to wake up, how much sleep they usually like, and how much coffee to drink.

## Topics Covered
- Steppers
- DatePicker
- DateFormatter, DateComponents, and Calendar
- Machine Learning with Core ML

## Issues
No known issues
## Thoughts
Machine Learning strikes me as an interesting topic for further study.
