# GuessTheFlag
GuessTheFlag is the second project in the SwiftUI in 100 Days series.   
## Overview
The project is a guessing game the helps users learn flags from nations around the world.
## Topics Covered
- Stacks - VStack, HStack, ZStack
- Colors and Frames
- Gradients
- Buttons and Images
- Alerts
## Issues
Some of the text cuts off, need to look into the best way to make sure all text is visible.
## Thoughts
The posted challenges pretty simple, just adding a couple @State properties to manage score and improve alert display.

Some potential ways to improve this and make it more fun, would be to add more flags, and prevent an answer from being the same as the previous answer.
