# WeSplit

This is the first project in the SwiftUI 100 days series. 

## Overview
This simple utility app that splits a check + tip amongst a given number of people.

## Topics Covered
- the @State property wrapper 
- Forms, Groups, and Sections
- Navigation Views and navigation bar titles
- Interface Controls such as TextField and Picker
- Creating views with ForEach

## Issues
I've only played around with this in the simulator, but the keyboard is not working consistently.    

## Thoughts
It would be nice to clean this up with a nicer presentation and forcing my input to be within valid range (i.e. forcing the check amount to only use digits).   

As I learn more SwiftUI and get back into iOS development, this is a nice little project that I can come back to and improve upon it.
