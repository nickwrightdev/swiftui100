# Multiply

This is the third challenge.   The aim is to make a "Edutainment" app with multiplication tables.    
## Project Requirements
- The player selects which multiplication tables they want to practice.  Can use buttons or a Stepper from 1...12.
- The player selects how many questions they want to answer.  5, 10, 20, or all.
- You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for. For the “all” case you should generate all possible combinations.

## Issues
None reported.

## Thoughts
The game works as is, but I need to spend some time making this look nice and add some animation using what I've learned so far.

Most important is to create a nicer way to input answers.
