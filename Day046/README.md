# Day 46
Project 9 review and challenges.

I got 11/12 on the review questions.

In addition to the challenges, I created a root navigation view that will switch between all the different experiments created for project 9.

### Challenge
Extend the Drawing app with some of my own code.

#### Challenge 1
> Create an Arrow shape made from a rectangle and a triangle.   Having it point straight up is fine

I thought using a rectangle and a triangle looked kinda weird, I couldn't get it to work without a line between them.   Instead I drew out a nice rectangle. 

#### Challenge 2

> Make the line thickness of your Arrow shape animatable.

I'm not sure this is exactly what is being asked for, since I used a slider.   I should come back to this and make it work with taps like the trapezoid for the animation sake.
#### Challenge 3

> Create a ColorCyclingRectangle shape that is a rectangular cousin of ColorCyclingCircle, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using a property.
